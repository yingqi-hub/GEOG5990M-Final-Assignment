# GEOG5990M-Final-Assignment
# Spatial Variation in Commuting Distance Across Leeds

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and data for a spatial data science project completed as part of the module **GEOG5415M**.  
The project investigates how average commuting distance varies across Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) in Leeds using openly available census and spatial boundary data.

Commuting distance is an important indicator of transport accessibility, sustainability, and quality of life. Understanding spatial variation in commuting behaviour can support evidence-based transport planning and inform policies aimed at reducing transport-related inequality and carbon emissions.

   Description: Spatial boundaries for Lower Layer Super Output Areas within the Leeds local authority.

2. **Commuting Distance Data (Census 2021)**  
   Source: Nomis (UK Census)  
   Description: Aggregated counts of employed residents by distance travelled to work, provided at the LSOA level.

All data included in this repository are provided under open data licences.
